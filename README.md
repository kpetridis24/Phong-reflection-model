# projections-transformations

3D object projection to camera & application of rotations and displacements. The main parts of the project are

- **Projection** of the 3D object into the camera. This part includes coordinate system tranformations and projection methods to correspond 3D coordinates to 2D.
- **Rasterization** from the curtain of the camera into the image frame. 
- **Rendering** of the object and **display**.
- **Transformations** including rotation and displacement of the visualized object. This part consists of **Affine Transformations** on the coordinates of the object.
